# 📊 Turing College Data Analytics Roadmap

This repository documents the full learning path I completed at **Turing College**, a rigorous, project-based data analytics program. Over the course of the curriculum, I developed a strong foundation in data analysis, communication, and applied machine learning. The program emphasized hands-on learning, business impact, and real-world datasets.
