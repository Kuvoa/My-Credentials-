# Turing College Data Analytics Roadmap

This repository documents the full learning path I completed at **Turing College**, a rigorous, project-based data analytics program. Over the course of the curriculum, I developed a strong foundation in data analysis, communication, and applied machine learning. The program emphasized hands-on learning, business impact, and real-world datasets.

## Roadmap Overview

### Introduction to Data Analytics
- Developed a strong understanding of the data analytics workflow
- Learned the difference between descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive analytics
- Practiced formulating business questions and aligning them with data strategy

---

## Technical Tracks

### Structured Approach to Data Analytics
- Scoped projects and broke them into manageable parts
- Applied frameworks to investigate problems, build hypotheses, and structure insights
- Emphasized stakeholder communication and hypothesis-driven analysis

### Spreadsheets for Data Analytics
- Proficient in Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets
- Applied functions such as `VLOOKUP`, `INDEX-MATCH`, pivot tables, conditional formatting, and IF statements
- Built financial models and dashboards using spreadsheet tools

### SQL & Databases
- Wrote queries to extract, filter, and join datasets from relational databases
- Used `GROUP BY`, `JOIN`, `HAVING`, `CASE`, and nested subqueries
- Applied window functions and Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

### Advanced SQL
- Developed proficiency in analytical SQL functions such as `RANK()`, `LEAD()`, `LAG()`
- Created performance-optimized queries and built multi-step pipelines with CTEs
- Conducted funnel and retention analyses using SQL alone

---

## Communicating Analysis Results

### Power BI Dashboards
- Created interactive dashboards for business decision-making
- Integrated data sources, built KPIs, and added filters and slicers
- Used DAX to build calculated measures and logic-driven metrics

### Presentations & Soft Skills
- Presented analytical findings to non-technical stakeholders
- Developed storytelling techniques to explain insights and drive business action
- Practiced soft skills such as stakeholder empathy and structured communication

---

## Main Analytical Topics

### Retention, Cohorts & Churn
- Analyzed customer lifecycles to understand behavior over time
- Built cohort tables, churn curves, and retention matrices
- Suggested business strategies based on cohort trends

### Funnels
- Constructed funnel visualizations to track conversion between user stages
- Identified bottlenecks and drop-offs in user journeys
- Recommended optimizations based on funnel data

### CLV, Customer Segmentation & RFM
- Applied RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to segment customers
- Manually scored and clustered customers based on purchase behavior
- Estimated Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) and suggested retention strategies

### Statistical Inference & A/B Testing
- Performed hypothesis testing using t-tests and chi-squared tests
- Conducted A/B test analysis including p-values, confidence intervals, and lift
- Interpreted results to inform marketing and product decisions

---

## Python for Data Analytics

### First Steps into Programming
- Learned Python fundamentals: variables, functions, loops, and conditionals
- Wrote simple programs for data manipulation and automation

### Data Processing with Pandas
- Cleaned, filtered, grouped, and transformed datasets using Pandas
- Managed missing values, duplicates, and outliers
- Engineered features and handled categorical variables

### Data Visualization with Python
- Visualized data using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Created histograms, bar charts, box plots, line plots, and heatmaps
- Customized plots for storytelling and analytical presentations

### Machine Learning
- Built and evaluated predictive models using Scikit-learn
- Applied logistic regression, decision trees, and KNN
- Assessed performance with accuracy, precision, recall, ROC curves, and confusion matrices
